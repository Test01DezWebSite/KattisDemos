# Java Kattis / cold problem

This is a netbeans / maven project.  I am not suggesting that all of these tests are the right way to quickly solve a problem in a contest environment. But I am suggesting writting this as an example of well tested code using JUnit 4.

The first tests of main and run are actually counter examples: they are the
hardest to write and the least important.  A properly factored solution should
be easier to test and debug.
